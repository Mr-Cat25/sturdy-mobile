# Sturdy Architecture

## Overview

Sturdy is a crisis-first AI parenting assistant built for real-time support during hard moments.

The system is designed around four goals:

- fast response time
- structured and predictable output
- child-specific personalization
- safety-aware guidance

Instead of acting like a general chatbot, Sturdy behaves like a focused parenting tool that turns a parent’s input into a practical script.

Every AI response follows:

**Regulate → Connect → Guide**

## Responsibilities by Layer

### Mobile App

The mobile app is the parent-facing product.

It handles:

- sign up and sign in
- child profile creation
- chat input
- script display
- saved scripts
- conversation history
- subscription UX

### Supabase

Supabase provides the application backend.

It handles:

- authentication
- PostgreSQL database
- row-level security
- Edge Functions
- future analytics and storage

### Edge Functions

Edge Functions are the orchestration layer.

They handle:

- user validation
- child profile lookup
- prompt building
- safety detection
- AI model calls
- response normalization
- message persistence

### OpenAI

The model is used for structured script generation.

It does not run the product logic directly. The product logic stays in the Edge Function so outputs remain consistent and controlled.

---

## Product Modes

Sturdy is designed with two main AI modes.

### 1. Hard Moment Mode

This is the primary mode.

Use cases:

- hitting
- screaming
- refusal
- transitions
- leaving activities
- bedtime conflict
- sibling conflict

Response style:

- short
- calm
- firm
- actionable
- structured

### 2. Reflection Mode

This is a secondary mode for after the crisis.

Use cases:

- understanding patterns
- planning for next time
- reviewing what happened
- preparing scripts in advance

Response style:

- slightly more explanatory
- still practical
- still brief
- child-specific

---

```

---

## Database Design

The schema is designed to support:

- multiple children per parent
- multiple conversations per child
- structured AI messages
- saved scripts
- future personalization

### 1. profiles

Stores base user metadata.

```text
profiles
- id uuid primary key
- created_at timestamptz
```

### 2. child_profiles

Stores child context used to personalize scripts.

```text
child_profiles
- id uuid primary key
- user_id uuid
- name text
- age_band text
- neurotype text[]
- created_at timestamptz
```

### 3. conversations

Stores each chat session.

```text
conversations
- id uuid primary key
- user_id uuid
- child_profile_id uuid
- mode text
- title text
- created_at timestamptz
- updated_at timestamptz
```

### 4. messages

Stores user and assistant turns.

```text
messages
- id uuid primary key
- conversation_id uuid
- role text
- content text
- structured jsonb
- created_at timestamptz
```

### 5. saved_scripts

Planned table for reusable favorite scripts.

```text
saved_scripts
- id uuid primary key
- user_id uuid
- child_profile_id uuid
- title text
- structured jsonb
- source_conversation_id uuid
- created_at timestamptz
```

### 6. child_behavior_patterns

Planned table for learning what works for each child.

```text
child_behavior_patterns
- id uuid primary key
- child_profile_id uuid
- trigger text
- strategy text
- success_rating int
- notes text
- created_at timestamptz
```

This table is the foundation of long-term personalization.

---

## Row-Level Security Strategy

RLS is essential because parenting conversations and child data are highly sensitive.

Rules:

- users can only see their own child profiles
- users can only see their own conversations
- users can only see messages belonging to their conversations
- insert/update access is limited to the owning user

This ensures each parent’s data stays isolated.

---

## AI Response Design

The AI is not allowed to freestyle output. It must return structured JSON.

### Response Schema

```json
{
  "mode": "hard_moment",
  "situation_summary": "Child is overwhelmed because screen time ended.",
  "parent_tone": "calm, low voice, few words",
  "regulate": {
    "parent_action": "Take one breath and lower your voice.",
    "script": "I’m here. I won’t let you hit."
  },
  "connect": {
    "parent_action": "Name the feeling briefly.",
    "script": "You really wanted more TV."
  },
  "guide": {
    "parent_action": "Set the limit and give one next step.",
    "script": "TV is off. You can sit with me or stomp your feet."
  },
  "avoid": [
    "Stop this right now",
    "You’re being ridiculous"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Keep sentences short",
    "Avoid reasoning during escalation"
  ],
  "safety_escalation": false
}
```

### Why Structured Output Matters

Structured output gives Sturdy:

- predictable UX
- cleaner rendering
- safer moderation
- easier testing
- analytics-friendly data
- faster future iteration

---

## Prompt Assembly Flow

The prompt is assembled server-side.

Inputs include:

- current mode
- parent message
- child age band
- child neurotype
- child name if available
- recent conversation context
- future: previous successful strategies

### Prompt Layers

```text
Base system rules
    +
Mode-specific instructions
    +
Child profile context
    +
Recent conversation turns
    +
Current parent message
```

### Prompt Rules

The assistant must:

- be calm, firm, practical
- avoid therapy jargon
- avoid diagnosis
- avoid shaming
- use short sentences
- give spoken scripts parents can say aloud
- adapt to age and neurotype
- prioritize safety

---

## Safety Architecture

Sturdy must detect high-risk situations before normal AI generation.

### Example Safety Triggers

- “I want to hit my child”
- “My child can’t breathe”
- “They are hurting themselves”
- “I think I might lose control”
- “My baby was shaken”
- “They ran away”
- “There is a weapon”

### Safety Flow

```text
Parent message
    │
    ▼
Keyword + classifier safety check
    │
    ├── Safe: proceed to AI generation
    └── Unsafe: return safety-first response
```

### Safety Response Principles

- stop normal coaching
- prioritize physical safety
- reduce language load
- advise emergency help when appropriate
- avoid long analysis

---

## Conversation and Message Lifecycle

### Create Conversation

A new conversation is created when the user starts a new chat or when no existing conversation is present.

### Store User Message

The parent’s message is stored immediately.

### Generate Assistant Response

The model returns structured JSON.

### Store Assistant Message

The assistant response is stored as both:

- raw content
- structured JSON

This preserves both auditability and render-friendly data.

---

## Personalization Architecture

This is the most important future differentiator.

### Current Personalization

Today the app personalizes by:

- age band
- neurotype
- current conversation context

### Future Personalization

Later the app should also personalize by:

- repeated triggers
- strategies that worked
- strategies that failed
- common settings
- time-of-day patterns
- transition-related challenges

### Future Learning Loop

```text
AI script shown
    │
    ▼
Parent feedback: "Did this help?"
    │
    ▼
Store result in child_behavior_patterns
    │
    ▼
Include known successful strategies in future prompts
```

This creates a child-specific behavior memory system.

---

## API Design

### 1. Generate Script

```http
POST /functions/v1/chat-parenting-assistant
```

#### Request

```json
{
  "conversationId": "uuid",
  "childProfileId": "uuid",
  "mode": "hard_moment",
  "message": "My child is screaming because we have to leave the park."
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "mode": "hard_moment",
  "situation_summary": "Child is overwhelmed about leaving the park.",
  "parent_tone": "steady, calm, low voice",
  "regulate": {
    "parent_action": "Take one breath and move closer.",
    "script": "I’m here. I won’t let you kick."
  },
  "connect": {
    "parent_action": "Name the feeling simply.",
    "script": "You really wanted to stay."
  },
  "guide": {
    "parent_action": "Set the limit and offer one next step.",
    "script": "We are leaving now. Hold my hand or I will carry you."
  },
  "avoid": ["Stop this right now"],
  "notes": ["Keep talking minimal"],
  "safety_escalation": false
}
```

### 2. List Conversations

Planned:

```http
GET /functions/v1/list-conversations
```

### 3. Get Conversation Detail

Planned:

```http
GET /functions/v1/get-conversation?id={conversationId}
```

### 4. Save Script

Planned:

```http
POST /functions/v1/save-script
```

### 5. Sync Subscription

Planned:

```http
POST /functions/v1/sync-subscription
```

---

## Subscription Architecture

RevenueCat is planned for subscription management.

### Free Tier
- limited script generations
- limited conversation history

### Premium Tier
- unlimited AI chat
- saved scripts
- future behavior insights
- future coach mode

### Enforcement Strategy

Subscription checks should happen server-side before AI generation to prevent client-only bypasses.

---

## Observability and Analytics

Planned telemetry should include:

- request count
- generation latency
- safety escalation rate
- script save rate
- retry rate
- top trigger categories
- most effective scripts by child profile type

This will help improve both the product and model performance.

---

## Scaling Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale incrementally.

### Why This Stack Works Early

- mobile app is fast to ship
- Supabase minimizes backend overhead
- Edge Functions keep orchestration simple
- structured AI output reduces UI complexity

### Scaling Later

As usage grows, Sturdy can add:

- streaming responses
- prompt caching
- message summarization
- background analytics pipelines
- specialized models for safety classification
- admin review tools

---

## Security and Privacy Considerations

Sturdy handles highly sensitive family data.

Important safeguards:

- row-level security in Postgres
- authenticated Edge Function calls
- limited prompt context
- no unnecessary data exposure to the client
- future encryption and retention policies

---
